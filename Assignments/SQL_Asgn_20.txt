/* Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)? */

Create View Dailyorders
as Select Distinct cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders;




/* Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include only the snum and comm fields. Through this view, someone could enter
or change commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20. */

CREATE VIEW commission AS SELECT snum, comm FROM salespeople WHERE comm BETWEEN .10 AND .20;




/* Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date, sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”. 
The word SYSDATE can therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when
the value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table. Create the
Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given. */
